# headphone-eq-configs
Ever bought headphones for, like, $5, and then realized they were lowkey unusable and wished that someone made them usable in some way?
Well, fear not. I've been in your situation and learned how to EQ them, and then decided to share the configs for, like, the 2 people 
that bought those models too.

So, what can you expect?
- Neutral response curve, manually crafted around '500hz = +0db' for headphone models nobody cares about (or just hasn't made a config for)
- EasyEQ configs for such headphones as:
   - P47 headphones from Aliexpress
   -  F68 headphones from Pepco
   -  Sologic headohones from Action
   -  Baseus E17
   -  Oppo Enco Air V3
   -  HP Laptop 15 speakers (wtf)
   -  Probably more if you decide to contribute
- GraphicEQ files soon (that means support for EqualizerAPO)
- Support for AutoEQ file format/Wavelet soon via a generator script

Community contributions are welcome! 
If you have EQ configs for other (obscure) headphones, make a pull request. 
If you found some imperfection in my configs, open an issue, and I might integrate your fix.
